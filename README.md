## 📂 Data Source

**Dataset:** UK Road Accident Dataset (from Kaggle)  
**Coverage:** National traffic and road safety reports  
**Period:** 2021–2022 (monthly and yearly data)

Includes details such as:
- Accident Date & Time  
- Vehicle Type (Car, Bus, Van, Bike, etc.)  
- Road Type (Single carriageway, Dual carriageway, Roundabout, etc.)  
- Road Surface Condition (Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice)  
- Light Condition (Daylight, Dark)  
- Casualty Type & Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)  
- Location Area (Urban or Rural)

## 📊 Data Quality Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Completeness** | Some records have missing values (e.g., surface, light condition) |
| **Consistency** | Standardized vehicle and casualty classifications |
| **Accuracy** | Represents reported national incidents, excluding unreported cases |
| **Format** | CSV format – analyzed using Microsoft Excel |

---

## 🎯 Analysis Objectives

This project aims to provide data-driven insights into UK road accidents through Excel dashboards and visualizations.

### Key Questions:
- What is the total number of casualties by year and severity?  
- How do accidents differ between **Urban vs Rural** areas?  
- What is the correlation between **weather**, **light**, and **road surface** conditions?  
- Which vehicle type is most commonly involved in accidents?  
- How did accident trends change from **2021 to 2022**?

---

## 🧩 Analysis Scope

- **Time Frame:** 2021–2022  
- **Focus Areas:** Accident frequency, severity, and environmental conditions  
- **Primary Tool:** Microsoft Excel  
- **Techniques Used:** Pivot tables, charts, slicers, and conditional formatting

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Total Casualties** | 222,146 |
| **Fatal Casualties** | 4,280 (1.9%) |
| **Serious Casualties** | 32,267 (14.5%) |
| **Slight Casualties** | 185,599 (83.5%) |
| **Top Vehicle Type** | Car (≈80% of total accidents) |
| **Most Common Surface** | Dry roads (147,469 cases) |

### Dashboard Features:
- 📅 **Year Comparison (2021 vs 2022)**  
- 🚗 **Severity Breakdown by Vehicle Type**  
- 🌧️ **Weather & Surface Condition Analysis**  
- 🌆 **Urban vs Rural Accident Distribution**  
- 💡 **Impact of Light Condition (Daylight vs Dark)**

## 📖 Documentation

The dataset includes:
- Detailed field descriptions (Data Dictionary)  
- Cleaning & transformation notes  
- Summary tables for pivot chart references  
- Limitations (missing weather or road data, reporting gaps)

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Majority of accidents occur under **dry surface** and **daylight conditions**, suggesting behavioral rather than weather-based causes.  
- **Cars** dominate the total accident count (~80%).  
- Accident rates are higher in **urban areas**, but **rural roads** show higher fatality rates.  
- **2022** shows a slight reduction in total casualties compared to **2021**.

---

## 🚀 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboarding  
- **Data Analysis Techniques:** Trend analysis, aggregation, and data visualization  
- **Data Interpretation:** Identifying accident patterns and safety insights
